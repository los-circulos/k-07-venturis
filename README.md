# k-07 3d printed venturis for glow model engines

3d printing heat and chemical resistant venturi tubes is now possible.

Suggested material: Currently I'm printing them from PA12 (nylon12) with or without CF reinforcment. Plain PETG did not work very well but nylon does.

Print settings: I use slighty higher than necesary temperature for better adhesion. Also, using adhesion skirt (which touches the part) really help with the initial adhesion.

Printing with PA12 and 102.04% scale gives me true size results

I will most probably continue adding designs for more motors.

File name pattern: venturis-{diameter}x{base length}-[all|{inner diameter}]-{engine}.[blend|stl|gcode]
Eg.
venturis-8.5x7.9-all-GP15.blend - contains venturi with 8.5 mm shaft diameter, 7.9 mm shaft length, all internal diameters, for GP15 engines.

Also, relevant file names might include "NoX" (No1, No2 etc) which means:

 - No1 - traditional needle-through or nozzle-through design
 - No2 - offset needle which also holds the venturi in place and there is a small built-in nozzle hole
 - No2.2 - same as No2 but with 2 feeding holes

Where noted, a small rubber (or even better nitrile) O ring shall be used (currently some older designs lack this)

Supported engines - recommended inner diameter and O ring:

 - GP15 - 3mm
 - GP25 - ... / 8x2mm
 - FX25 - ... / 11x2mm
 - LA15 - ???
 - LA46 - ???
